In this example, we use Beautiful Soup to parse the HTML of the page at the given URL, and then we search for all of the <a> (link) tags on the page. We then check each link to see if it is from a known source of fake news, and if any of the links are from such a source, we return True to indicate that the news is fake. If none of the links are from known fake news sources, we return False to indicate that the news is real.# Fake-news
